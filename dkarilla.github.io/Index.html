            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a third-year public relations major at the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications. I consider myself an enthusiastic, hard working young woman interested in social media management, research and planning. My strengths are my responsibility, integrity and positivity.</p>
        <p><img src="img/karilla.jpg" width="25%" title="you got it, dude" alt="Karilla Dyer" /></p>
            <p>I am a dual citizen of Brazil and was raised to be a world traveler. My travels have taken me to three continents and nine countries. I have a passion for learning about other cultures and people. I have a love of teaching and mentoring, which inspired me to help guide freshman first-generation students through college as a First Year Florida peer leader and peer mentor. I have also taught a listening and speaking course for students learning English at the University of Florida English Language Institute. I enjoy blogging about food, travel and film. I write fiction stories in my free time. My life's dream is to become a published author. </p>
            <p>I plan to pursue a masterâ€™s degree in management at the University of Florida following the completion of my undergraduate career. I hope to start my public relations career as a press secretary before transitioning into the corporate world. </p>
